### üëã Hi, i‚Äôm Daria!
I am a Junior QA Engineer based in Berlin with 3 years of hands-on experience in manual web and mobile testing. I have a passion for solving problems and structuring my work. I also enjoy doing API and stress testing.

I am currently heavily involved in developing my skills and knowledge in software testing by attending online courses and testing web applications for learning purposes. Although English is not my first language, I am making every effort to improve my communication skills.

I look forward to applying what I have learnt to the role of Software Tester and continuing to grow.
